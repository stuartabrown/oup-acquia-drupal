# Expectations

- (Drupal) Layout elements should be styled with appropriate padding on the _left and right_, vertical spacing should be
  added using Spacer block in Drupal.
  - Only exception is in a multi-column layout, vertical spacing between two columns (for small screen) can be applied
    where appropriate.
